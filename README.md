This was a follow-up to my KMeansColorSegmentation. This was still prior to becoming a Computer Science major and as such is clumsily written and inefficient. This was only my second real project.

MedicalSegmentation

This program takes initial CT scans and a physician determined initial outline and segments the target organ from the surrounding tissue.
The output image is a K-Means color segmented production of the liver.
